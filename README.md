# A coupling interface between Serpent and FEMAXI-7

**Written in python 3**

To use the coupling interface, one must hold valid **[Serpent](https://www.oecd-nea.org/tools/abstract/detail/NEA-1840")** and **[FEMAXI](https://www.oecd-nea.org/tools/abstract/detail/NEA-1080)** lincense.

## Introduction

The interface is written to achieve coupled calculation of Serpent 2 and FEMAXI-7. The couple scheme include steady state coupling and one-way coupling. Two-way coupling is under development. To use transient coupling mode, the version of Serpent should be 2.1.28 or later.
