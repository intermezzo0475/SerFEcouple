<h1>A coupling interface between Serpent and FEMAXI-7</h1>

**Written in python 3**
<p> To use the coupling interface, one must hold valid **[Serpent](https://www.oecd-nea.org/tools/abstract/detail/NEA-1840)** and **[FEMAXI]**(https://www.oecd-nea.org/tools/abstract/detail/NEA-1080) lincense.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>the interface is written to achieve coupled calculation of Serpent 2 and FEMAXI-7. The couple scheme include steady state coupling and one-way coupling. Two-way coupling is under development.</p>
